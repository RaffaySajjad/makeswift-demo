What inspired you to join the Crew?</h4>
  <p>I was inspired to join the crew because of Shapermint’s mission and values. I was also inspired by the positive and inspiring community.</p>
  <h4>What do you enjoy most about being on the Crew?</h4>
  <p>I enjoy connecting with such great, supportive, and relatable individuals within the Shapermint crew and beyond.</p>
  <h4>How do you want to shape change with us?</h4>
  <p>I want to shape change by sharing my personal journey of self-love. I aim to inspire others to love who they are through self-confidence and self-acceptance.</p>
  <h4>How do you define body positivity?</h4>
  <p><span class=""cominew"">""</span><em style=""font-style: italic;"">Body positivity is accepting and loving all of you. Being confident in your unique body, feeling and seeing what your body is capable of, and enjoying the body that you’ve been blessed with.</em><span class=""cominew"">""</span> - Theresa</p>

Do you have any particular rituals or routines that spark self-love?</h4>
  <p>I have daily routines throughout the day that fill up my cup. In the mornings, I enjoy sitting quietly and practicing gratitude through journaling. After work, I head to the gym for some stress relief through physical activity. To end the night, I have a relaxing skincare routine.</p>
  <h4>We absolutely love the fact that you use social media as a liberating force to celebrate body positivity and other movers &amp; shapers out there. Are there any women on social media who inspire you to be your best self?</h4>
  <p>I am inspired by Shapermint Mama Nicole @Chillmomvibes. She inspires me with her positivity to be confident and accepting of who I am.</p>
  <h4>How important has stocking up on basics been to you during the quarantine?</h4>
  <p>Stocking up on basics has been so important because I am always home. Working from home, I needed styles that are versatile. My wardrobe shifted to pieces that are comfortable, essential, and supportive.</p>

  <p>My top tip would be to find pieces that make you feel good about yourself inside and out. When you feel good, it positively influences your mindset and could get you excited to try some new styles.</p>
  <h4>What is your favorite Shapermint style? How do you like to style it?</h4>
  <p>My favorite Shapermint style would be the <a href=""https://shapermint.com/products/empetua-high-waisted-shaping-leggings"">high waist leggings</a> paired with the <a href=""https://shapermint.com/products/truekind-daily-comfort-wirefree-shaper-bra"">comfort wireless bra</a> or <a href=""https://shapermint.com/collections/bras/sports"">sports bra</a>. I like to style it by adding a button-up top or sweater, depending on the season.</p>
